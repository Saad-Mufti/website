#### Hi, I'm Saad.
I'm an undergraduate student at Georgia Tech in my second year. I'm majoring in computer engineering and am primarily interested in computers. It started with using them for exploring the web and all the entertainment that came with it, and then turned into making entertainment in the form of a small game, which is why I'm here today.

I lived for much of my life in Shrewsbury, MA, and went to high school at St. John's, a Catholic school for boys. Now I live in Alpharetta, GA.
