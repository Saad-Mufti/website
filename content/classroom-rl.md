### Building Dynamic Classroom Environments with RL

My final CS 539 (Machine Learning) project, done with another classmate, was an RL model designed to help students concentrate in a classroom type environment.

We start with our primary goal: We wanted to help students pay better attention in class, by tuning their environment to be as stimulating as possible. With this in mind, some pretty obvious ideas came up, such as adjusting the temperature to make students comfortable, but not fully *relaxed*.

We realized there are also other ways of controlling a classroom environment, including:
- Lighting: Make sure the individual student doesn't feel that the classroom is too dark or bright.
- Air flow: Students may be uncomfortable if they feel a draft.
