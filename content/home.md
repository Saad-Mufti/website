## Saad Mufti
Hi! I'm Saad, and I'm an undergrad at Georgia Tech. My passion is computers, how they improve our lives, and how we can make them better. Recently, I've been looking more closely at how we can move and direct data at the macroscale - with data processing pipelines in the cloud. 

I've also been exploring machine learning, specifically reinforcement learning, to apply it in everyday scenarios. In the past, I've worked on embedded systems, full-stack web development, and mobile development. I enjoy working in collaborative environments and working on particularly hard problems. My experience working in groups and working on problems some of my peers would abandon out of frustration has helped me become a team player with persistence.

### What is this website?
I created this site initially to share some of the more interesting things I've done with anyone who may be interested. I've tried to make some of the more technical content approachable for people who may not have heard of those topics before, which I hope might help get them interested in making their own embedded designs, or mobile app, or something along those lines.

That is, I hope I can get the readers of this page interested in software, computers, and what their future might bring us! If you have input with how I am doing on that, I would love to hear from you!


### Goals
For the purposes of tracking my growth and keeping myself accountable to my targets as time passes, I've listed my (relatively) long-term goals here, in a loose chronological ordering:
1. Finish my Master's program - I hope to finish my Bachelor's by the Spring of 2024, after which I plan to enroll in Georgia Tech's BS/MS program. My hope is that I can explore cutting-edge topics in computer architecture and VLSI. Naturally, if I want to stay on track and eligible, I need to maintain a high GPA and take higher level classes during my final year, which will count towards my MS degree.
2. I want to work at a startup that inspires me, within the next 3 years - startup companies are often the key primers for introducing a new product to the world that changes people's lives, and the individuals behind startups work fast and with remarkable efficiency. I hope to be a part of that. I've found Ampere Computing and Cerebrum to be the more innovative chip design companies lately, and I would love to join their teams!
3. Work on a new computing paradigm - Outside of conventional computing, neuromorphic computing and quantum computing are on the cusp of changing the world of computation. I want to be a part of these efforts and make an impact as well! To get into these emerging industries, I plan on sharing with you some projects I will be working on over the next few months or so, to familiarize myself with the basics. Check back soon!
